    <li class="html">
        The root element of an HTML page is represented by the HTML element <span
            class="tagName shadow">html</span>, which is also known as the root
        element. This element must be the ancestor of all other elements.
    </li>
    <li class="base">
        The base URL for all relative URLs in a document is specified by the HTML element known as "base". A document
        may
        only contain one <span class="tagName shadow">base</span> element.

        Scripts can use Node.baseURI to get the base URL used by a document. BaseURI defaults to location.href in the
        absence of any base elements in the document.
    </li>
    <li class="head">
        The
        <span class="tagName shadow">head</span> HTML element contains machine-readable information

    </li>
    <li class="link">
        The HTML element known as <span class="tagName shadow">link</span> describes connections between the
        current content and other resources. This
        element is most frequently used to connect to stylesheets, but it may also be used to create site icons,
        including
        "favicon"-style icons and icons for mobile devices' home screens and applications.

    </li>
    <li class="meta">
        The HTML element <span class="tagName shadow">meta</span> is used to express metadata that cannot be
        represented by other elements related to
        HTML meta, such as "base," "link," "script," "style," or "title."
    </li>
        <li class="style">
        A document's or a section of a document's style information is contained in the HTML element "style". It
        includes
        CSS, which is used to style the text and images in the page that contains the <span
            class="tagName shadow">style</span> element.
    </li>
    <li class="title">

        simply includes text.
    </li>

    <li class="body">
        The content of an HTML document is represented by the <span class="tagName shadow">body</span> HTML

        element known as <span class="tagName shadow">article</span> in a document, page, application, or
        website. An interactive widget or gadget, a
        forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, or any other standalone piece of
        content
        are examples.
    </li>
    <li class="aside">
        A section of a document whose content is only loosely connected to the page's main content is represented by the
        HTML element <span class="tagName shadow">aside</span>. Sidebars or call-out boxes are common ways to
        convey asides.
    </li>
    <li class="footer">
        The HTML element <span class="tagName shadow">footer</span> specifies a footer for its ancestor

    </li>
    <li class="header">
        The HTML element <span class="tagName shadow">header</span> designates introductory information,

        Six levels of section headers are represented by the HTML elements <span
            class="tagName shadow">h1</span>&nbsp;through <span classtagname="">h6</span>. The

        The primary material of a document's body is represented by the HTML element <span
            class="tagName shadow">main</span>.&nbsp;The key subject of a
        document or the primary function of an application is expanded upon or directly connected in the main content
        section.
    </li>
    <li class="nav">
        An area of a page designated as <span class="tagName shadow">nav</span> in HTML designates a part
        whose function is to offer navigation links,

        illustrations of navigation sections.
    </li>
    <li class="section">
        A generic freestanding part of a page that lacks a more specialized semantic element is represented by the HTML
        element <span class="tagName shadow">section</span>. Only very seldom should a section not have a
